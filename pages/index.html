      <h4>Semantic HTML</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of
          the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has
          included semantic markup from its inception,[84] but has also included
          presentational markup, such as &lt;font>, &lt;i> and &lt;center> tags.
          There are also the semantically neutral div and span tags. Since the
          late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most
          browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of
          presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of content
          and presentation.

        <p>
          In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others
          gave examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents" may one
          day automatically crawl the web and find, filter, and correlate
          previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human
          users.[86] Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the
          ideas of Web 2.0, mashups and price comparison websites may be coming
          close. The main difference between these web application hybrids and
          Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current
          aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed by
          web developers, who already know the web locations and the API
          semantics of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.
